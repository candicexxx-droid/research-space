## Project Description
Our team creates a welcoming platform, Research Space,  for students and faculties to communicate opportunities of academic research. In our platform, research opportunities from different academic departments (Engineering, Physical Science, Life Science and Medical School, and Life Science and Social Science) can be posted by users. Users can also log into the system to view opportunity posts, save posts that they are interested in to their account, and view posts published by themselves in their profile page. 





## Run the App Locally
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
first you will need to install node on your device, if you don't have node install goto [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the Recommended version.

### After cloned this repository, do 
`cd research-sapce`

### Install package to be used
**Note: if you already have those packages installed then you can ignore this step**
````
```
npm install axios
npm install classnames 
npm install --save prop-types 
npm install react-session-api
npm install react-select
npm install react-bootstrap
npm install react-router-dom
npm install sass
```
````

### Start the App, run script:

`npm start` to run the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
